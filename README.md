# kos-c

This project contains a compiler for a C/C++/C#-like language targeting the kOS scripting language used in the Kerbal Operating System mod (https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/index.html) for Kerbal Space Program.

The inspiration for this project came from a certain incident where one of my drones literally crashed due to a type error after roughly 30 minutes of flight time.

Thus, in order to prevent such frustrating incidents in the future, `kos-c` was born.

# Language Features

# Roadmap

# Implementation
