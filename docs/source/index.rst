   Installation <installation>

Welcome to the documentation of **kOS-C**, a typed language for the `Kerbal
Operating System`__ (kOS) mod for Kerbal Space Program. This project is an
add-on providing an alternative frontend for the untyped scripting language
employed by kOS.

What is kOS-C?
--------------

**kOS-C** is a programming language with a syntax inspired by other C-like languages
such as C++, C#, etc. It comes with a compiler that transforms **kOS-C** code into
kOS scripts that can then be used inside Kerbal Space Program without further
modifications.

In contrast to kOS, it provides a static type system with support for generic
types and a module system. Additionally, the code generated by the **kOS-C**
compiler optionally renames identifiers in order to make the resulting code
shorter. This is especially important with the CPU parts unlocked in the early
game which only provide limited storage capacity.

Why another language?
---------------------

Since I personally believe that static (type) checking of programs is incredibly
useful for preventing common mistakes I was not quite satisfied with the
available options. Creating a language that compiles to the scripting language
employed by kOS seemed to be the easiest route in fixing this "problem".

Moreover, **kOS-C** is planned to be interoperable with kOS scripts. That means that
existing kOS code can be easily integrated into **kOS-C** programs, and the code
generated by **kOS-C** should be usable by other kOS scripts.

How to install kOS-C?
---------------------

In short: there are prepackaged binaries in the `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/fatho/kos-c/releases/latest>`__. A more detailed guide to
building **kOS-C** can be found in the section :ref:`Installation`.
